## **:octicons-question-16: Why Feature Documentation Matters**

Clear documentation helps you better understand what each feature does, why it exists, and how to use it effectively. Our goal is to empower you to:

* Discover new Playlab features you might not know about
* Understand the rationale behind each feature's design
* Learn best practices for implementing features into your Playlab projects
* Troubleshoot common issues independently

## **:material-brain: Our Development Philosophy**

At Playlab, we follow these principles when developing new features:

!!! info "Learning-Centered Design"
    * Every feature supports our mission of building AI literacy through play and experimentation

!!! info "Inclusive Design"
    * Features are accessible to users with varying technical backgrounds
    * We believe in low floors and high ceilings

!!! info "Community-Driven Development"
    * Many features originate from Playlab community feedback and observed needs
    * We actively incorporate user testing feedback into feature iterations
