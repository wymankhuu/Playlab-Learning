# **Richer Starter Inputs**

## **:material-new-box: What is this feature?**

Playlab now supports Richer Starter Inputs, allowing builders to add diverse input types when creating apps. You can now include short text, long text, dropdown selections, and file uploads (up to 5MB), giving your users more flexibility in how they interact with your apps.

---

## **:material-chat-question: Rationale for the feature**

Previously, Playlab users were limited in how they could structure inputs. With Richer Starter Inputs, builders can tailor input types to fit specific use cases, enhancing the overall user experience. 

Whether you need structured responses via dropdowns, open-ended text input, dropdowns or an upload file to help you get your interaction started, this update makes it easier to collect and leverage the required data to get you started.
