## 🔑 Our Learning Beliefs

!!! note "AI isn't magic...it's math"
    It's important to understand how Generative AI works so we can become more critical creators of AI.

!!! success "AI has great potential and great risks🛠️"
    We are very early. AI has both vast potential and risk but it's important that we build our own AI intution through experience.

!!! example "You learn about AI by playing with AI in community"
    Learn by doing, and doing it with other people

!!! example "You are already an AI person"
    AI is already all around us, how will we collectively bend it for our contexts?
